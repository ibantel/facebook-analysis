# facebook-analysis
Analysis of the data collected querying the Facebook Graph API (see separate repository), as conducted per my MPhil thesis (2018)

Analysis of two separate data sets originating from querying the Facebook Graph API: "posts count" and "posts analysis".
For the former, one case is one terrorist attack; the data set contains information on the number of posts in reaction to the respective attack.
In the latter, each case is one post (multiple posts per attack); the data set contains information on the reactions to the posts.
